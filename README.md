# Starstruck (2016-2017)
Old Dominion's VEX U Team has two subteams, a Senior Design Team for senior engineers and a Club Team for general members. This is the Team's repository to hold all code for the VEX U Robotics Starstruck Competition Season.

## Software Packages
All code in this repository was built using one of two software suites. Install files can be found at the links below or on our Team's [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bwvi-fTSujznZnM3YXFCbFVxQXc?usp=sharing).
- [PROS](http://pros.cs.purdue.edu/) - an open source compiler built by the Purdue VEX U Robotics Team, the [ACM SIGBots](https://www.purduesigbots.com/).
- [ROBOTC](http://www.robotc.net/download/vexrobotics/) - the oficial coding software of the VEX Robotics Competition.

## Senior Design Team
The Senior Design Team is comprised of senior level engineering students from the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering departments. Anyone on this team has chosen the VEX U Robotics Competition as their senior capstone design project.

### Edward Clawhands
Edward Clawhands, sometimes called Monica, was the Senior Design Teams first robot of the Starstruck season. It was used at a scrimmage in November 2016, held at the College of Southern Maryland.

## Club Team
The Club Team is comprised of students from all years (Freshman to Senior) and a variety of majors (Mechanical, Electrical, Computer, Civil, Computer Science, Modeling and Simulation, etc.). These members are all volunteers who build the robots in their spare time.

### Jerry
Jerry was the Club Team's first robot. Jerryrigged together for a scrimmage held at the College of Southern Maryland in November 2016.
